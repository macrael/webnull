Webnull

x make it append the shibboleth on first run
x make it blackhole the website
x make it not blackhole an already managed website
x make it unblackhole a site
x make it re-blackhole a site
x refactor the two methods, too much shared
x make it unblackhole a site for (5) minutes.
x make it catch ctl-c
* make it unblackhole all
* make it unblackhole until tomorrow
* update readme


BACKLOG
* make a man page
* write a dotfile so that when moving to a new machine I can bring it all along
	* ugh this probably makes concurrancy way more real.
	* might be nice because we can just rewrite the whole file every time instead of doing parts?
* don't do two reads everytime
* switch from localhost addresses to invalid addresses. 

BUGS
* sometimes, it takes a minute for the website (twitter) to go away, do I need to kill some daemon or reset some cache or something?
    * Seems Safari related. pinging it or trying to open it in Chrome fails. 
x webnull www.reddit.com doesn't strip the www. off


there should be a switch to enable, ideally enable for a set time.
usage: sudo webnull --enable (-e) facebook
usage: sudo webnull --enable-all (-a)
usage: sudo webnull -et 30 facebook

default is 5 minutes
-t in minutes
--tomorrow -m ? -- enable until tomorrow
-am == all until tomorrow

* we should only have 1 waiting at a time, so we write when we do this.
* file locking? possible?
* catch ctl-c and reset the file in that case

* how do I solve having two different sites enabled in two different terminals?
