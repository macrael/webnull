Webnull

x make it append the shibboleth on first run
x make it blackhole the website
* make it not blackhole an already managed website
* make it unblackhole for minutes.




BACKLOG
* make a man page
* write a dotfile so that when moving to a new machine I can bring it all along
	* ugh this probably makes concurrancy way more real.
	* might be nice because we can just rewrite the whole file every time instead of doing parts?


BUGS
* sometimes, it takes a minute for the website to go away, do I need to kill some daemon or reset some cache or something?


A tool for blackholing websites. 


usage: sudo webnull http://facebook.com
		sudo webnull facebook.com
facebook will no longer be reachable. 


maybe there should be a switch to enable, ideally enable for a set time.
usage: sudo webnull --enable (-e) facebook
usage: sudo webnull --enable-all (-a)
usage: sudo webnull -e -t 30 facebook

default is 5 minutes
-t in minutes

* we should only have 1 waiting at a time, so we write when we do this.
* file locking? possible?
* catch ctl-c and reset the file in that case
