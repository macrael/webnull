Webnull

x make it append the shibboleth on first run
x make it blackhole the website
x make it not blackhole an already managed website
x make it unblackhole a site
x make it re-blackhole a site
x refactor the two methods, too much shared
x make it unblackhole a site for (5) minutes.
x make it catch ctl-c
x switch to the local dummy hosts when you pass an enviornment variable
x make it unblackhole all
x switch to command based UI
x update readme
* refactor, way too much shared code again.
* make it unblackhole until tomorrow
* If you -e a pattern that matches nothing, print an error and don't time
* list the patterns that actually matched
* make sure that .'s in the search name aren't being used as . in the re
    * or do I want to go whole hog and let the sitename be a pattern? I'm injecting it into one...
* don't add www if there's already a subdomain
* could add short command names "d" and "a"
* write tests. Should be pretty straightforward. intput, output, etc. 
    * might need to be able to specify hostfile location somehow. 

BACKLOG
* make a man page
* write a dotfile so that when moving to a new machine I can bring it all along
	* ugh this probably makes concurrancy way more real.
	* might be nice because we can just rewrite the whole file every time instead of doing parts?
* don't do two reads everytime
    * maybe store the read in local variables. 
* switch from localhost addresses to invalid addresses. 
* make not using sudo print a nicer error

BUGS
* sometimes, it takes a minute for the website (twitter) to go away, do I need to kill some daemon or reset some cache or something?
    * Seems Safari related. pinging it or trying to open it in Chrome fails. 
x webnull www.reddit.com doesn't strip the www. off

UI
---
Comand based. 

rn: deny/allow

webnull deny example.com
webnull d example.com ??

webnull allow [-tamf] example.com
webnull a example.com ??

webnull remove example.com

deny/permit
disallow/allow
blackhole/unblackhole
disconnect/connect/reconnect

usage: sudo webnull deny facebook.com
usage: sudo webnull allow facebook
usage: sudo webnull allow -a
usage: sudo webnull allow -t 30 facebook
usage: sudo webnull allow -f (f == forever, remove the listing from the managed set.)
    * should -f just permanetly comment it out or remove it from the list?
        * if commented out, we should have another command that removes it from the list...

default is 5 minutes
-t in minutes
--tomorrow -m ? -- enable until tomorrow
-am == all until tomorrow

* we should only have 1 waiting at a time, so we write when we do this.
* file locking? possible?

* how do I solve having two different sites enabled in two different terminals?
